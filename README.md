# Workout-Tracker

## Description

The Workout Tracker allows you to create workouts and add to specific workouts in order to track your progress.  You can view your progress in a dashboard that displays results in a line and pie chart.       

## Technologies
The Workout Tracker was created using node.js and the dependencies used were: Mongoose to use/write data to and from the database, express to route the database info to/from the user page.    

## Usage

To start, click New Workout and choose from a dropdown between resistance and cardio.  Once a selection is made fill in the info pertaining to your workout and click complete.  From that point you can create additional New Workouts or add to workouts with Continue Workouts which can then be viewed in the dashboard.  You can navigate to the dashboard by clicking "Dashboard" in the top left corner of the page.  To return to the New Workout and Continue Workout section click in "Fitness Tracker" in the top left corner.
